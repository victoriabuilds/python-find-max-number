 Finding the Maximum Value in a List**
 
I am  given a list of integers. My task is to write a Python program that finds and prints the **maximum number** in the list.

For example, given the list:

# Given list of numbers
numbers = [13, 99, 6, 76, 11, 83, 27, 84, 28, 67, 66, 22, 96, 46, 63, 21, 65, 48, 8, 14, 84, 22, 28, 11, 83, 87, 11, 76, 6, 83, 27]



The program should output:

The maximum value in the list is: 99
